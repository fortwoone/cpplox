This is a C++ interpreter for Lox, made while taking on the
["Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) by CodeCrafters.

Said challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

NOTE: Lox is a language created solely for the purpose of said book.
